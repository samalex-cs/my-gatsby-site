Her mother was Julia Prinsep Jackson and her father Leslie Stephen. While the boys in the family received college educations, the girls were home-schooled in English classics and Victorian literature. An important influence in Virginia Woolf's early life was the summer home the family used in St Ives, Cornwall, where she first saw the Godrevy Lighthouse, which was to become central in her novel To the Lighthouse (1927).","tags":[],"locale":"en-us","ACL":{},"uid":"blta84678afb09e1725","_version":1,"_in_progress":false,"publish_details":[{"environment":"blt2a20d33e043e0fd7","locale":"en-us","time":"2023-11-22T10:04:16.608Z","user":"blt024bb6855b1c804a","version":1},{"environment":"blt5a565ce66a5e63f7","locale":"en-us","time":"2023-11-22T10:04:16.611Z","user":"blt024bb6855b1c804a","version":1},{"environment":"blt63260dcaf08fdf37","locale":"en-us","time":"2023-11-22T10:04:16.614Z","user":"blt024bb6855b1c804a","version":1}]},"blte9a4fe2cce0a2358":{"title":"Mark Twain","picture":{"uid":"blt1c08215f8be997ed","created_at":"2023-11-22T10:02:39.811Z","updated_at":"2023-11-22T10:02:39.811Z","created_by":"blt024bb6855b1c804a","updated_by":"blt024bb6855b1c804a","content_type":"image/jpeg","file_size":"148713","tags":[],"filename":"Mark_Twain_Headshot.jpg","url":"https://images.contentstack.io/v3/assets/blta50759e9488f5330/blt1c08215f8be997ed/655dd1bf53094912a03f067c/Mark_Twain_Headshot.jpg","ACL":[],"is_dir":false,"parent_uid":"blt981702b02c2dcdac","_version":1,"title":"Mark Twain","description":"","publish_details":[{"environment":"blt2a20d33e043e0fd7","locale":"en-us","time":"2023-11-22T10:02:41.015Z","user":"blt024bb6855b1c804a","version":1},{"environment":"blt2a20d33e043e0fd7","locale":"fr-fr","time":"2023-11-22T10:02:40.996Z","user":"blt024bb6855b1c804a","version":1},{"environment":"blt5a565ce66a5e63f7","locale":"en-us","time":"2023-11-22T10:02:41.020Z","user":"blt024bb6855b1c804a","version":1},{"environment":"blt5a565ce66a5e63f7","locale":"fr-fr","time":"2023-11-22T10:02:41.002Z","user":"blt024bb6855b1c804a","version":1},{"environment":"blt63260dcaf08fdf37","locale":"en-us","time":"2023-11-22T10:02:41.025Z","user":"blt024bb6855b1c804a","version":1},{"environment":"blt63260dcaf08fdf37","locale":"fr-fr","time":"2023-11-22T10:02:41.007Z","user":"blt024bb6855b1c804a","version":1}]},"bio":"Twain was raised in Hannibal, Missouri, which later provided the setting for Tom Sawyer and Huckleberry Finn.

He later became a riverboat pilot on the Mississippi River before heading west to join Orion in Nevada. He referred humorously to his lack of success at mining, turning to journalism for the Virginia City Territorial Enterprise. His humorous story, \"The Celebrated Jumping Frog of Calaveras County\", was published in 1865, based on a story that he heard at Angels Hotel in Angels Camp, California, where he had spent some time as a miner. The short story brought international attention and was even translated into French. His wit and satire, in prose and in speech, earned praise from critics and peers, and he was a friend to presidents, artists, industrialists, and European royalty.","tags":[],"locale":"en-us","ACL":{},"uid":"blte9a4fe2cce0a2358","_version":1,"_in_progress":false,"publish_details":[{"environment":"blt2a20d33e043e0fd7","locale":"en-us","time":"2023-11-22T10:04:17.251Z","user":"blt024bb6855b1c804a","version":1},{"environment":"blt5a565ce66a5e63f7","locale":"en-us","time":"2023-11-22T10:04:17.258Z","user":"blt024bb6855b1c804a","version":1},{"environment":"blt63260dcaf08fdf37","locale":"en-us","time":"2023-11-22T10:04:17.263Z","user":"blt024bb6855b1c804a","version":1}]},"blt297c4a4dc9b0ff88":{"title":"Maya Angelou","picture":{"uid":"blt2a68727337343133","created_at":"2023-11-22T10:02:03.068Z","updated_at":"2023-11-22T10:02:03.068Z","created_by":"blt024bb6855b1c804a","updated_by":"blt024bb6855b1c804a","content_type":"image/jpeg","file_size":"41226","tags":[],"filename":"Maya_Angelou_Headshot.jpg","url":"https://images.contentstack.io/v3/assets/blta50759e9488f5330/blt2a68727337343133/655dd19b80ab2302a9fd3d94/Maya_Angelou_Headshot.jpg","ACL":[],"is_dir":false,"parent_uid":"blt981702b02c2dcdac","_version":1,"title":"Maya Angelou","description":"","publish_details":[{"environment":"blt2a20d33e043e0fd7","locale":"en-us","time":"2023-11-22T10:02:04.178Z","user":"blt024bb6855b1c804a","version":1},{"environment":"blt2a20d33e043e0fd7","locale":"fr-fr","time":"2023-11-22T10:02:04.166Z","user":"blt024bb6855b1c804a","version":1},{"environment":"blt5a565ce66a5e63f7","locale":"en-us","time":"2023-11-22T10:02:04.181Z","user":"blt024bb6855b1c804a","version":1},{"environment":"blt5a565ce66a5e63f7","locale":"fr-fr","time":"2023-11-22T10:02:04.170Z","user":"blt024bb6855b1c804a","version":1},{"environment":"blt63260dcaf08fdf37","locale":"en-us","time":"2023-11-22T10:02:04.185Z","user":"blt024bb6855b1c804a","version":1},{"environment":"blt63260dcaf08fdf37","locale":"fr-fr","time":"2023-11-22T10:02:04.173Z","user":"blt024bb6855b1c804a","version":1}]},"bio":"Became a poet and writer after a string of odd jobs during her young adulthood.
